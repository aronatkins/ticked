On a timer, flush the buckets to mongo.

When we shift something off the buckets list, flush to mongo.

Maybe do bucket-list trimming on a timer and not on the request path.

On some schedule, reduce all the per-minute data to per-hour, per-day,
per-week. Maybe do cleanup of the per-minute metrics, too.
